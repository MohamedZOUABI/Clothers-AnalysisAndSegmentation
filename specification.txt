What hardware you need for full dataset training

For full DeepFashion2 training (191,961 training images), here are practical requirements:

Minimal setup (slow but possible)

    - GPU: ≥ 16GB VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA V100, A100 40GB, RTX 3090, RTX 4090, RTX 6000 Ada)

    - CPU: ≥ 16 cores (Ryzen 9, Intel i9, Xeon)

    - RAM: ≥ 64GB system memory (for dataloading + annotations)

    - Disk: ~500GB SSD (dataset + checkpoints + logs)

Recommended setup (balanced training speed)

    - Multi-GPU: 2× or 4× A100 40GB / H100 80GB

    - CPU: ≥ 32 cores

    - RAM: ≥ 128GB

    - Disk: ≥ 1TB NVMe SSD


Training time: still several days depending on batch size + epochs.
